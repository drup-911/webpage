        <h3>Engineering Book Reselling & Workshop Platform</h3>
        <p>This project aims to provide a platform for engineering students to resell and buy engineering books, as well as access useful workshops. The platform also offers a feature to purchase tickets for workshops and connects students across the KTU network, similar to a LinkedIn for engineering students. This project was developed as part of my Engineering Entrepreneurship and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) course, combining real-world business ideas with technological solutions.</p>
